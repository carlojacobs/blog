## Introduction
Wether you are a seasoned programmer or a beginner, you have to make sure you build up a collection of the things you build. This portfolio can actually help you out a lot when applying for a job, applying for college, or just impressing your friends. However, building your portfolio can be quite difficult and, if you don't start early, you're going to have some trouble. Here are some things I have learned.

## Just start
It doesn't matter where. Your first projects won't be crucial to your portfolio. Just go and build something. The more you think about what you're going to build, the harder it will be to start. Just pick something and start working on it. By doing this, you'll learn about the process of creation and you'll gain experience in development. This will help you build bigger and better projects later on.

## Keep track of your stuff
When you're busy working on a project, make sure to keep track of that project and what you're doing. Even when you think it will be a total flop. I have discarded numerous projects in the past thinking that they were no good when, in hindsight, they would have fitted nicely in my portfolio.

## Be original
When choosing a big project that you are planning on completing all the way, be original. If you want to impress people with your project and come across as a skilled programmer, originality is crucial. Don't make another instagram or facebook clone. Don't make another notes or todo's app. In stead, make something that is original, weird or funny. Even if it is completely useless. For example, one of my favourite projects was a neural network that I made. I made it so that it could predict your chances of surviving the titanic disaster. Completely useless, but it original and fun.

If your idea is not original, there's a good chance that someone somewhere has already had the same idea. This someone probably had a bigger team and a lot more programming power than you, making your finished product seem like peanuts compared to theirs. By being original, you allow yourself some wiggleroom. You're projects will seem much more professional and impressive because you were the first to make such a thing.

## Have fun
Don't take programming too seriously. Remember: you're doing this because you like it. Choose your language, framework or other tools with your heart and build something that genuinely interests you. This will automatically make your projects of highger quality.

Good luck on your programming endeavours!
